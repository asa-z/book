# The Redox Book

## Development

We use [mdBook](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook), a Rust tool to create online 
books from Markdown.

Start a development server on http://localhost:3000 with the following command

```
mdbook serve
```

Some graphics are in svg and are associated with their corresponding .xml source file.
You can edit the graphic by using the .xml on [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).
