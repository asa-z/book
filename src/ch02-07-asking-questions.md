Asking questions, giving feedback, or anything else
===================================================

The quickest and most open way to **communicate with the Redox team** is on our **chat server**. Currently, you can only get an invite by sending an email request to [info@redox-os.org](mailto:info@redox-os.org), which might take a little while, since it's not automated. Simply say you'd like to join the chat. We're working on a better way to do this, but this is the best way right now.

Alternatively you can use [our Forum].
