# Low-Hanging Fruit

## aka Easy Targets for Newbies, Quick Wins for Pros

If you're not fluent in Rust:

 * Writing documentation
 * Using/testing Redox, filing issues for bugs and needed features
 * Web development ([Redox website, separate repo](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/website))
 * Writing unit tests (may require minimal knowledge of rust)

If you are fluent in Rust, but not OS Development:

 * Apps development
 * Shell ([Ion](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/ion)) development
 * Package manager ([pkgutils](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/pkgutils)) development
 * Other high-level code tasks

If you are fluent in Rust, and have experience with OS Dev:

 * Familiarize yourself with the repository and codebase
 * Grep for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`, `UNOPTIMIZED`, `REWRITEME`, `DOCME`, and `PRETTYFYME` and fix the code you find.
 * Improve and optimize code, especially in the kernel
