This chapter will be dedicated to exploring every aspect of a running Redox system, in gruesome detail.

We will start with the boot system, continuing to the shell and command-line utilities, moving on to the GUI, all while explaining where things happen, and how to change them.

Redox is meant to be an *insanely* customizable system, allowing a user to tear it down to a very small command-line distro, or build it up to a full desktop environment with ease.
